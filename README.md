# parking-capacity-melbourne

This is a simple web app which measures the proportion of occupied on street car parking bays in the City of Melbourne and compares it to the unoccupied proportion as well as any which are unknown at the time. It should update every 2 minutes upon refresh, although it doesn't seem to be doing that at the moment.

Feel free copy the project and use it how you want. If you want to run it locally you'll need a local host to do so. You can also view a version of it [here](https://biskwikman.github.io/projects/melbourne-parking-capacity/).

If you want to have a closer look at the data from City of Melbourne that can be found at City of Melbourne's [Open Data Portal](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/On-street-Parking-Bay-Sensors/vh2v-4nfs).

I used [d3pie](http://d3pie.org/) to make the pie chart in this app.
